I developed lab materials for the "practical" part of the course, which was about learning how to develop games in Unity.
The course covers a large portion of Unity's features and includes step-by-step lessons and hands-on exercises. 
At the end, students are expected to be able to put together a complete game prototype.
Below is a synopsis of the course. If you're interested about it, contact me!
