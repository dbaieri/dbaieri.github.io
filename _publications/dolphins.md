We address the problem of estimating the metric 3D shape and motion of wild dolphins from monocular video, with the aim of assessing their body condition. While considerable progress has been made in reconstructing 3D models of terrestrial quadrupeds, aquatic animals remain unexplored due to the difficulty of observing them in their natural underwater environment. To address this, we propose a model-based approach that incorporates a transmission model to account for water-induced occlusion. We apply our method to video captured under different sea conditions. We estimate mass and volume, and compare our results to a manual 2D measurements-based method.
