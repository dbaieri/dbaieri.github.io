In this talk I gave for Ph.D. students at the CS department in Siegen, I discussed an often overlooked aspect of CV/AI research: keeping things efficient enough to be employed in practical settings.
CG pipelines are a prime example of this issue: if we want to integrate new smart tech in movie/videogame production, we need to be aware of its impact on rendering time/runtime FPS. 
The talk explored some of my recent publications, especially on efficient neural shape representations and fast algorithms for their manipulation.
