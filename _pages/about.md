I am a PostDoc researcher, currently in the 3DiG group led by Prof. Simone Melzi, at University of Milano-Bicocca.
I received my Ph.D. from Sapienza University of Rome in 2024, where I was tutored by Prof. Emanuele Rodolà.

My research goal is to empower 3D artists with intelligent, efficient tools for 3D graphics production pipelines.
Specifically, my research interests include **neural representations**, **Gaussian splatting**, and **geometric deep learning**.

I have several non-research interests, including (but not limited to) music, sports, food, gaming and traveling. 
If you want to chat about research of one of my other interests, feel free to contact me! Also, I will be at the following conferences:
 
* ...
* ~~NeurIPS 2025, San Diego CA, USA~~
* ~~ECCV 2024, Milan, IT~~
* ~~IGS 2023, Genoa, IT~~
* ~~SIGGRAPH 2022, Vancouver, CA~~
