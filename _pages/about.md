I am a PostDoc researcher, currently in the DiG-AiR group at University of Milano-Bicocca.
I received my Ph.D. from Sapienza University of Rome in 2024, where I was tutored by Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†.

My research goal is to empower 3D artists with intelligent, efficient tools for 3D graphics production pipelines.
Specifically, my research interests include **neural representations**, **Gaussian splatting**, and **geometric deep learning**.

My other interests in life include music, sports, cooking, gaming and traveling. 
If you want to chat about any of these, feel free to contact me! Also, I will be at the following conferences:
